# rpi-sew-rs485

Janky approach to controlling SEW MoviMot VFDs from s7-1200/s7-1500 PLC Controllers via RPI4 & FTL232 based USB <-> RS485 module.
Project is not really maintained outside of changes&fixes needed for my particular use case, as the RPI4s are bound to be swapped with an actual SEW Profinet Field distributors... Any time soon now!
